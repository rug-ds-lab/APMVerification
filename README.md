## Business process verification package

* Generation of a declarative process specification describing the common behavior of one or more related [pnml](http://www.pnml.org/) process model variants.
* Verification of a pnml process model against a generated or custom specification using the [NuSMV2](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/)/[NuXMV](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/) model checker.
