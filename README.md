## Business process verification package
The business process verification package provides generic verification tools for Petri net based business process models.

The package provides the following functionality:
* Generation of a declarative process specification describing the common behavior of one or more related [pnml](http://www.pnml.org/) process model variants.
* Verification of a pnml process model against a generated or custom specification using the [NuSMV2](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/)/[NuXMV](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/) model checker.

### Structure
The package is structured as followed:

* lib
* resources
* nl.rug.ds.bpm
  * event
    * listener
  * eventStructure
  * pnmlTools
    * specification
    * verifier
  * specification

### Usage
The package provides two core functionalities contained within the following classes:

* nl.rug.ds.bpm.variability.VariabilitySpecification
* nl.rug.ds.bpm.verification.Verifier

Self explanatory examples using these classes can be found in nl.rug.ds.bpm.pnmlTools.

### Custom specifications
Specifications can be either generated automatically or defined manually.

    <bpmSpecification>
        <specificationSets>
            <specificationSet>
                <specifications>
                    <specification id="s1" type="AlwaysResponse">
                        <inputElements>
                            <inputElement target="p">start</inputElement>
                            <inputElement target="q">transition3</inputElement>
                            <inputElement target="q">transition4</inputElement>
                        </inputElements>
                    </specification>
                    <specification id="s2" type="AlwaysNext">
                        <inputElements>
                            <inputElement target="p">transition1</inputElement>
                            <inputElement target="q">transition3</inputElement>
                        </inputElements>
                    </specification>
                </specifications>
            </specificationSet>
        </specificationSets>

        <elementGroups>
            <group id="start">
                <elements>
                    <element>transition1</element>
                    <element>transition2</element>
                </elements>
            </group>
        </elementGroups>

        <specificationTypes>
            <specificationType id="AlwaysNext">
                <inputs>
                    <input type="or">p</input>
                    <input type="or">q</input>
                </inputs>
                <formulas>
                    <formula language="CTLSPEC">AG(p -> A[p U q])</formula>
                </formulas>
            </specificationType>
        </specificationTypes>
    </bpmSpecification>

For example, the listing above forms the following specification:

    AG((transition1 | transition2) -> AF(transition3 | transition4))
    AG(transition1 -> A[transition1 U transition3])

Specifications are divided into specificationSets to ensure effective model reduction. For each specificationSet a
separate model is generated, reduced, and verified. Reduction is accomplished by calculating a stutter equivalent model
with respect to the used input elements for each set.

Each specification is defined by an id, type, and a list of inputElements. Each id should be unique and is used for
feedback purposes. The type refers to a specificationType which is either predefined in resources/specificationTypes.xml
or defined custom. The list of inputElements target the inputs of the specificationType. In case of overloading a
target, the inputElements form a dis/con-junction as defined by that target's type.

The optional elementGroups block defines sets of elements belonging to a group given an id. This id can then be used as
an input element throughout the specification. Elements within a group form a disjunction.

The optional specificationTypes block defines custom specificationTypes by a unique id, one or more formulas, and its
inputs. The language of a formula can be either _CTLSPEC_, _LTLSPEC_, or _JUSTICE_ as defined by the
[NuSMV2](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/)/[NuXMV](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/) model checker.

### Other Petri net formats

The verification classes can be easily extended to allow the use of other Petri net formats. All that is required is a
class that extends nl.rug.ds.bpm.verification.stepper.Stepper, which is then passed to nl.rug.ds.bpm.verification.Verifier.

Your Stepper should implement the following three methods:

	public Marking initialMarking()
	% Returns the initial marking of your net

	public Set<Marking> fireTransition(Marking marking, String transition, Set<String> conditions)
	% Given a current marking, the unique identifier of a transition, and optional limiting
	% conditions, returns the marking after firing the transition starting from the given marking.

	public Set<Set<String>> parallelActivatedTransitions(Marking marking)
	% Given a marking, returns Y_par(M) as defined in [2].
